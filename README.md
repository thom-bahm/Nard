# Nard
Simple 2D Board Game in Unity

Ultimately this project has a small goal to make a playable game against an AI (maybe networking if I get into it), but mostly for the purpose of learning how to write the AI for a basic decision set.

This game (Nard) is / is based on the following [quick article](http://www.cyningstan.com/game/389/nard) which lists the rules and origins; It is an extremely old, and *extremely* simple board game:

Current state: Basic game logic is pretty close to 'finished', all movement & mid play game states are correctly implemented, just need to do the take-piece and win logic -> Then comes the real fun work of trying to implement the AI. 

Hopefully very soon!
